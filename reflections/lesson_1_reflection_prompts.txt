GIT and GITHUB - Udacity Coursec

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Look at the specific differences between files and compare. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could try things, but then go back to a previous version
     if you went down a path that didn't work.
     Also, if another person made a change in your file and broke it,
     you could go back to an older version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Git pro - you can save at logical points where things are working
    Git con - you need to be conscientious about saving
    Google pro - it adds extra points in case you forget to save things
    Google con - save points may not make sense if partway through a task

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git - multiple files are dependant on each other
    Google Docs - files are not connected to/depending on each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use 'git log' to list commits for the dir that you're in
    Use 'git diff commit#1 commit#2' to compare two commits
     (you will see -hthshkssk etc. in red for lines deleted; you 
     will see +isisgigi etc. in green for lines added)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This would be very reassuring - to know that I can 
    always go back to an older version of a file and 
    then find the differences between files. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to be able to use Git to store and track the files for my WordPress sites. I would especially like to try it on our new website - I could clone _underscores and use it as a basis for building a new template :)
