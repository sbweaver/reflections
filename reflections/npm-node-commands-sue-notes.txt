NPM and NODE.js Commands and Notes (Sue Baily Weaver)

1) "npm install --save grunt-sass"  = command to install a package (grunt-sass) - add "sudo " to the beginning on Mac

2) "npm init" = installs npm within the folder that you are in - goes through series of questions needed to build "package.json" file

3) "npm install -save-dev whatever-you-are-installing" = installs the package as a developer dependency (something you are using only to develop your app - the app does not need it to run so it doesn't need to be installed on the production server)

4) "npm list" = will show you everything that is installed in current dir (like "ls")

5) "npm -g list" = shows everything that is installed on your system

6) "npm install" = (first, you have gone into your package.json file and specified specific versions for packages like, 1.4.5, and you want those specific versions installed - when you run the command it installs them)

NOTE: if a version has "^1.5.6" the carot at the beginning indicates that you want the latest version installed

7) "npm outdated" = shows you any packages that are outdated, what version is Current, then Wanted and then Latest. 

8) "npm update" = if you add the carot (^) back in before the version number it will update to the latest version when this command is run

9) "npm uninstall grunt-whatever" = temporarily Uninstall a package - if you then run, "npm install" it will reinstall (doesn't remove the entry in package.json file)

10) "npm uninstall --save-dev grunt-whatever" = permanently uninstall a package (removes the entry in package.json file)

11) "npm prune" = deletes any folders/packages that are not included in your package.json file

12) CTRL C = stops a task from running in Command Prompt and brings back command prompt
