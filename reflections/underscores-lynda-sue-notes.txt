3) Tools > Plugins > Available Plugins > Darkula...

FOR LARGER FONT SIZE -- ALT-z and mouse-scroll-wheel up

-----

SETUP GULP

1) Put "gulp-dev" folder into "themes" dir

2) Go to "gulp-dev/package.json" - update settings, Git repository location if applicable

3) Navigate to "gulp-dev" dir - Run "npm install"

4) Go into "gulp-dev/node_modules/Gulpfile.js" - At top: make sure themename is set to your theme's slug; at the bottom: make sure that proxy is set to the URL of your theme (Ex: humescores.dev)

------
(took the following out of Gulpfile.js):
 "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/sbweaver/humescores.git"
  },
  "author": "Sue Baily Weaver",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/sbweaver/humescores/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/sbweaver/humescores/#readme",
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^6.5.2",
    "browser-sync": "^2.17.6",
    "gulp": "^3.9.1",
    "gulp-image": "^2.7.2",
    "gulp-jshint": "^2.0.2",
    "gulp-newer": "^1.3.0",
    "gulp-postcss": "^6.2.0",
    "gulp-sass": "^2.3.2",
    "gulp-sourcemaps": "^2.2.0",
    "jshint": "^2.9.4"
  }
}
------

5)From within "gulp-dev", issue the command, "gulp"

**Had issues with "gulp-sass" - it wouldn't install. Had to delete the "node_modules" dir, remove "node-sass" "package.json" file, and then ran "npm install gulp-sass --save-dev" to reinstall gulp-sass - had to then install other dependencies again. 

---------------------------

CHAPTER 2 - The Design to Development Process

DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself

Check out Template Hierarchy Diagram from WordPress.org

Also check out Morten's SASS Partials diagram to see where all of the SCSS pieces are.

------------------------------

CHAPTER 3 - Set Up the Basic Theme

3.1 - Update Metadata in "/themes/humescores/sass/style.scss"

3.2 - functions.php file

Notes: 

1) You can change the default background color and/or add a default background image

2) function humescores_content_width() - - sets the default width for YouTube videos and other content (only applies to outside content)

3) wp_enqueue_script - - very useful - you can add all sorts of scripts - there is another course devoted to this

4) towards bottom - "require get_template_directory() . 'inc/extra-files.php'" (these are broken out by area so that functions.php doesn't get too long)
	**Check out all files in /inc/ so that you understand them

-----

3.3 ENQUEUE and apply custom web FONTS

ADD Following to function.php file (added one wp_enqueue...):

function humescores_scripts() {
        // Enqueue Google Fonts: Source Sans Pro and PT Serif
        wp_enqueue_style( 'humescores-fonts', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=PT+Sans:400,400i,700,700i|Source+Sans+Pro:400,400i,600,900' );
        
APPLY FONTS:
	- Set variables for serif and sans-serif fonts (/sass/variables-site/_typography.scss)
	- Apply the variables to the files in the "typography" dir (/sass/typography/_headings.scss and /sass/typography/_typography.scss)


-----

3.4 TRANSLATION SETTINGS

Borrow code from 2017 theme - functions.php

find function called "twentyseventeen_fonts_url", copy, paste into humescores' functions.php file after "humescores setup"

CTRL-H - - to find and replace "twentyseventeen" with "humescores"


-----

3.5 PRECONNECT GOOGLE FONTS

Took the following from 'functions.php' in Twentyseventeen Theme and did search/replace of 'twentyseventeen' with 'humescores':

/**
 * Add preconnect for Google Fonts.
 *
 * @since Twenty Seventeen 1.0
 *
 * @param array  $urls           URLs to print for resource hints.
 * @param string $relation_type  The relation type the URLs are printed.
 * @return array $urls           URLs to print for resource hints.
 */
function twentyseventeen_resource_hints( $urls, $relation_type ) {
  if ( wp_style_is( 'twentyseventeen-fonts', 'queue' ) && 'preconnect' === $relation_type ) {
    $urls[] = array(
      'href' => 'https://fonts.gstatic.com',
      'crossorigin',
    );
  }

  return $urls;
}
add_filter( 'wp_resource_hints', 'twentyseventeen_resource_hints', 10, 2 );

------

3.6 
WORK WITH SASS and Sourcemaps

1) Go to site in Inspector for site - click 3 Dots at top right, then Settings

2) Check "Enable CSS Source Maps" in not already enabled

(couldn't get it to work in Chrome - Firefox Developer Edition works - i can see .scss files in Inspector)

------

3.7
CREATE RESPONSIVE TYPOGRAPHY

1) Navigate to BODY element in inspector to see font-size

2) It is a "mixin" - go to "_mixins-master.scss" in "mixins" dir

3) Change to px size you want and change "rem" to:
    Desired px size/Current px size = em/rem size

4) "typography/_typography.scss" - changed font-size mixin to .9

5) (same file) - added the following into css for "textarea":

        @media screen and (min-width: 700px) {
            @include font-size(1);
        }

6) "typography/_headings.scss" - added larger styles for all headings so that h6 isn't so small

------

3.8
LAY GROUNDWORK FOR RESPONSIVE LAYOUTS

1) Open "style.scss" - move "Content" section above "Widgets" (Morten's preference)

2) Go to "site/_site.scss" - Deleted two @import commands at top; made copy of "Posts and pages" section and renamed it "../layout/global"

3) Added the file "/layout/_global.scss" with padding on "site-container" set to 1em

4) "/variables-site/_structure.scss" - Added two variables: 

$query__small: 600px;
$query__medium: 900px;

5) Added media query to "/layout/_global.scss" as follows:

.site-content {
    padding: 1em;
    
    @media screen and (min-width: $query__small) {
        padding: 2em;
    }
}

---------------------

4.1 
STYLE DEFAULT HEADER

.site-title (is H1 for home, P for other pages)

/site/header/_header.scss



-----

4.2

Go into "inc/custom-header.php" - find "humescores_custom_header_setup" 

1) edit width/height, color

2) Copy code from top of same file (<?php if ( get_header_image()...)) - - paste in "header.php" above <header>

3) Adjust for borders/margins (had to remove margins from "figure" element in /elements/_elements.scss) AND added the following to _header.scss to make img block instead of inline (was adding space):

.header-image {
    max-height: 60vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    img {
        display: block;
        width: 100vw;
    }
}

------

4.3
SHOW HEADER IMG ONLY ON FRONT PAGE

added is_front_page - as condition in header.php

------

4.4 
ADD OPTIONAL CUSTOM LOGO

1) In "functions.php" after custom background feature, add:

        // Add theme support for custom logo
        add_theme_support( 'custom-logo', array(
            'width' => 90,
            'height' => 90,
            'flex-width' => true,
        ) );

2) Add logo in Customizer

3) Add code to "header.php" inside of "site-branding" div

  <?php the_custom_logo(); ?>

------

5.1
MENUS

1) Register the menu and add it to Customizer (in "functions.php"):

register_nav_menus( array, $locations = array() )

  register_nav_menus( array(
    'primary' => esc_html__( 'Header', 'humescores' ),
    'footer-social' => esc_html__( 'Footer-social', 'humescores' ),
  ) );



2) Display menu on the front end:

wp_nav_menu( array $args = array() )

------

5.3
BORROW TWENTYSEVENTEEN JAVASCRIPT

1) Copied /assets/js/navigation.js from "twentyseventeen" theme to 
/js/navigation.js in "humescores" (deleted what was there)

2) added jquery support to "functions.php" (added "jquery" in the array below)

function humescores_scripts() {

  wp_enqueue_script( 'humescores-navigation', get_template_directory_uri() . '/js/navigation.js', array('jquery'), '20151215', true );
