GIT and GITHUB

LESSON 2

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository tells GIT to begin tracking the 
	versions of the files in that directory -  - 
	If you don't do this, you won't be able to track
	your file versions.

2. How can you use the staging area to make sure you 
have one commit per logical change?

	After each logical change, you use "git add" to 
	add the files affected to the staging area, then 
	"git commit"

3. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches would allow me to try out areas and 
	still be able to go back to a working point; 
	I could name the branches so that they make 
	sense with whatever changes I was trying

4. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	I can see where changes occured in the history - 
	I can also tell what changes are missing from 
	particular branches

5. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	the result is that we now have both functionality -
	we use the diagram so that we can see where each 
	change was introduced and go back to any point in 
	either branch
